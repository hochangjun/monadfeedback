# Monad Feedback Form Project

## Background and Motivation
Building a feedback form similar to the mega feedback form for Monad Testnet applications. Users need to connect wallet and pay 0.1 MON to submit feedback (spam prevention). The form will collect detailed feedback about Monad Testnet applications and show user feedback history.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Wallet connection with Privy (configured via environment variables)
- Monad Testnet integration (Chain ID: 10143, auto network switching)
- Payment system (0.1 MON required to submit)
- Form validation and data storage
- Feedback history display
- Both light & dark mode UI

## High-level Task Breakdown
- [ ] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
- [ ] Set up Privy wallet connection
- [ ] Configure Monad Testnet network
- [ ] Create feedback form UI with all required fields
- [ ] Implement MON payment system
- [ ] Add feedback submission logic
- [ ] Create feedback history view
- [ ] Implement dark/light mode
- [ ] Style and polish UI

- If vulnerabilities appear in terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using -force git command
